# Lesson 7 (23/01/2019) - If statements and more types

## Topics

- All the JS we've covered in previous lessons
- Pseudocode
- Refactoring (DRY)

## Demo / Task

Create a programme which figures out who is through to the next round of bakeoff while following the problem solving steps of:

- identify and define problem
- consider / plan solution (pseudocode)
- carry out solution
- iterate on solution (refactor)

NOTE: remember to update the `script` tag in `index.html` to the file name of the step you want to view!

```js
var bakers = [
  {
    name: "Ken",
    wonFirstBattle: true
  },
  {
    name: "Ed",
    wonFirstBattle: false
  },
  {
    name: "Jack",
    wonFirstBattle: true
  },
  {
    name: "Tom",
    wonFirstBattle: false
  }
];
```
